# Regression---Predicting-Customer-Spend-in-Clothing-Stores
In this project, I utilized clothing store data to predict the average amount that customers will spend with the company annually. 

**Key Highlights**
- Applied Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression models to analyze and identify key patterns within customer data.
- Evaluated model performance using summary statistics, including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R² values.
- Leveraged Train-Test-Split and StandardScaler for data preparation, utilizing Numpy and Pandas libraries for efficient data manipulation and analysis.

**Questions Answered**
1. Does making more money (salary) tend to increase the number of purchases someone makes? Does it increase the total amount spent?


2. Has the store’s customer base changed over time (based on the height, waist size, and inseam per year)?
